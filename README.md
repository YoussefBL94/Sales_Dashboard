## *Overview*
This project involves creating an interactive sales dashboard using a sales dataset generated with AI. The dashboard is designed to help businesses make data-driven decisions by visualizing key sales metrics such as quantity, profit, and total sales.


## *Project Workflow*
### Dataset Generation:
The sales data was generated using AI, providing fields such as:
1. Product Categories
2. Sales Quantity
3. Profit
4. Total Sales
5. Other relevant sales metrics

### Data Organization:
Google Spreadsheets was used to clean, organize, and prepare the dataset for analysis. Data cleaning involved formatting, filtering, and ensuring data consistency.

### Dashboard Creation:
Tableau was used to build a highly interactive dashboard. The dashboard enables users to:
1. Filter sales data by product, region, or time period.
2. Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like total revenue, profit margins, and sales trends.
3. Explore the data through various charts and graphs to facilitate insights for data-driven decision-making.
